(1) VST SUPPORT

Please do not distribute Ardour with VST support under the package
name "ardour" (or any case-variant on that). Use some other name such
as "ardourvst", "ArdourVST", "ardour-vst" etc. In the near future,
work will be done to make it possible to share as much as possible of
the packaging. 

(2) STANDARD TEMPLATES

The templates in ./templates are intended for installation in
$prefix/share/ardour3/templates.
