/** Parent class for FileDescriptors.
 *
 *  When a subclass is instantiated, the file it describes is added to a
 *  list.  The FileDescriptor can be `allocated', meaning that its
 *  file will be opened on the filesystem, and can then be `released'.
 *  FileDescriptors are reference counted as they are allocated and
 *  released.  When a descriptor's refcount is 0, the file on the
 *  filesystem is eligible to be closed if necessary to free up file
 *  handles for other files.
 *
 *  The upshot of all this is that Ardour can manage the number of
 *  open files to stay within limits imposed by the operating system.
