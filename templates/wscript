# Paul notes (April 2013)
#
# There seems to be little point in including templates with Ardour
# until or as long as the input connections of tracks depends on
# the user's hardware configuration. This makes any pre-existing
# templates potentially wrong/useless/annoying for anyone who
# uses a different hardware input configuration than was used
# to create the templates.
#
# Templates should be created by the user, not by us.
#
# I modified the code below, but have not tested it. For now
# this directory will be removed from the top level wscript's
# list of children.
