/** A rectangular range of an automation line, used to express a selected area.
 *
 *  x coordinates start/end are in AutomationList model coordinates.
 *  y coordinates are a expressed as a fraction of the AutomationTimeAxisView's height, where 0 is the
 *  bottom of the track, and 1 is the top.
 *
 *  This representation falls between the visible GUI control points and
 *  the back-end "actual" automation points, some of which may not be
 *  visible; it is not trivial to convert from one of these to the
 *  other, so the AutomationSelectable is a kind of "best and worst of
 *  both worlds".
 *
 *  It offers a zoom-independent representation of a selected area of automation.
