  <title>Working with layers</title>
  <para>
    It is possible to arrange regions in a playlist (track) so that they
    overlap - one starts before another finishes, for example. Because of
    this, its important that there is a clear and understandable rule for
    what you will hear when playing back these kinds of region arrangements.
  </para>

  <para>
    Every region in a playlist is assigned to a layer. There can only ever
    be one region on a given layer, although rearranging the playlist
    (track) may change which region is on which layer. At any given point
    along the timeline, you will hear the uppermost region at that point.
  </para>

  <para>
    Of course, nothing in digital audio is ever quite that simple, and so
    there are some complications:
  </para>

  <section id="layers-crossfades">
    <title> Crossfades </title>
    <para>
      Whenever two regions overlap, there is the potential for a
      <link linkend="sn-working-with-crossfades">crossfade</link> between
      them. If the crossfade is not muted, then you will hear the contents
      of the crossfade during the overlap, not just the uppermost region.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="region-opacity">
    <title> Region Opacity </title>
    <para>
      With a nod to image manipulation programs, Ardour allows you to
      make regions transparent. By default, all regions are created opaque,
      which means that when they are playing, no region below them are
      audible. However, if you change the region to be transparent, the
      region will be audible together with any regions below it. This
      capability should probably not be abused; if you really want to mix
      sounds together in this way, they should probably be on their own
      tracks. Occasionally though, this can be a useful trick.
    </para>

    <para>
      To change the opacity of a region, popup the region's editor,
      accessible by context clicking on the region. Then click on the
      "opaque" button, turning it on or off as desired.
    </para>

  <section id="choice-of-layering">
    <title>Choice of layering</title>

    <para>
      There are two main decisions to be made with regard to how a playlist
      should be layered:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	Given overlapping regions, which order should they be layered in?
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	When should layering be changed?
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <section id="layering-order">
      <title>Layering Order</title>
      <para>
	Ardour provides three-and-a-half ways to decide on the order in which regions are layered.  The most basic choice is:
      </para>

      <variablelist>
	<title></title>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Most recently added regions are higher</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Regions which are later in time will be on higher layers.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Most recently added or edited regions are higher</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Regions which were more recently edited or added to the playlist
	      will be on higher layers.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Later regions are higher</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Regions which were more recently added to the playlist will be on higher
	      layers.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </section>

    <para>
      A new session has the layering style set to "Most recently edited or
      added regions are higher". To change the layering style, open the
      <emphasis>Session Properties</emphasis> dialogue and choose your layering
      style from the "Misc" page.  Changing the layering style only affects
      future edits to the playlist; the existing layering of all playlists is
      preserved when changing the layering mode.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="modifying-layering-by-hand">
    <title>Modifying Layering Explicitly</title>
    <para>
      If you want a particular region to be the uppermost when the current
      layering style has put it on a lower layer, context click on the
      region. Select the region from the menu that pops up, and in the
      submenu that appears, choose one of "Move region to lowest layer" or
      "Move region to upper layer". The layering for the playlist will be
      recalculated to ensure that the region is on the layer you chose.
      Note: these operations only have any effect if using one of the "Most
      recently .." layer models.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can see the precise layer a region is assigned in the popup region
      editor, accessible by context clicking on the region.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        At one time, Ardour offered more explicit control over the layering,
        allowing you to move regions up or down to specific layers. This was
        found to be problematic, confusing, and generally rendered
        unnecessary by both of the layering styles the program now offers.
