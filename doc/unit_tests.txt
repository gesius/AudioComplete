Running unit tests
------------------

This is slightly neater if you have doc/waft on your path.

1.  Pass --test to waf configure
2.  cd libs/ardour
3.  waft --targets=libardour-tests && ./run-tests.sh

The "--targets=libardour-tests" is optional, but it avoids a
rebuild of the whole gtk2_ardour (which isn't necessary for
running the tests).
